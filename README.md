# PPPPUnity

PPPPUnity is a remake of the original Px4U flash mod/game, redone to work stand-alone on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

[Unity 5.6.3](https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/patch-releases/5.6.3p1)

(Reccomended) [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)


### Installing

* Open Unity 5.6.3

* (if you install unity for the first time, you'll need to sign in)

* Press the "Open" button and browse to the folder you downloaded the repo to

* Select the folder as your project folder, this should automaticall import the project settings into unity.

* Done, have fun working on it.


## Running the tests

To quickly test the code, you can either attach visual studio to the unity debugger
(assuming you installed the unity plugin during installation)

This will allow you to break point the code while in play mode.

If not, put ```[Serializable]``` above your viariables to expose them to the editor.

## Deployment

To deploy, create a new merge request with the main branch (hopefully this branch) and request your work to be included in the next version.

If you're an artist, you can simply zip the files up, maintaining the proper file structure and distribute them on the discord.

If you need help or have questions, contact nry_chan on the [discord](https://discord.gg/dFqXTUg).
